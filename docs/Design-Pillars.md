# Design Pillars

- Clarity in Combat: readable telegraphs, reliable hit reg, fair counterplay.
- Fast Iteration: data-driven content via ScriptableObjects and editor tooling.
- Server Authority: server validates abilities and movement-critical effects.
- Visibility & Feedback: surface state (CC, shields, CDs) in HUD and nameplates.
- Operability: analytics, logs, and togglable debug for live balancing.

Non-Goals (EA)
- No long-form progression/grind; focus on core arena loop quality.
- No complex open-world systems; maps are curated arenas.
