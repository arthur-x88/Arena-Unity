# Design Pillars & Player Insights

Purpose
Summarize why WoW Arenas feel great and how we intentionally adapt those strengths—simplified for a casual‑friendly arena brawler.

Why WoW Arenas Were Engaging
- High stakes, high clarity: fights resolve fast; clean win conditions.
- Depth without bloat: abilities interact in interesting ways; expression via execution and comp, not gear grind.
- Player agency: counterplay, jukes, LoS, peels; outcome feels earned.
- Tight rounds: 5–15 minutes; fresh starts; low snowball vs. MOBAs.
- Skill ceiling: spacing, cooldown trading, cross‑CC, set‑ups, swaps.

How We Adapt (Arena Clash)
- Fixed kits, 4–6 abilities per class; no talent trees/gear; no RNG (crit/loot) in 0.1.
- Short matches (5–10 min), compact arenas with LoS obstacles and readable hazards.
- Mobility baseline (dash/quickstep) and clarity: big hitboxes, bold VFX/SFX.
- Server‑authoritative, low friction: get into a match in <30s (target).
- Progression = cosmetics and light mastery tracks; no P2W.

Casual Attractors
- Zero-to-fun in one match: fast queues, quick tutorial, versus AI option.
- Snappy feedback: hit sparks, stingers, camera shakes (lightweight), end-of-round highlights.
- Simple choices, deep outcomes: fixed kits + readable counters; “learn by doing.”
- Sessions that respect time: daily/weekly objectives, fair rewards in 1–2 games.

Design Guardrails
- NO grind gating core power; keep integrity of competitive fights.
- Accessibility first: colorblind and readability presets; input leniency; generous aim assist optional in PvE/AI.
- Fast iteration: balance as content; patch notes in-client.
