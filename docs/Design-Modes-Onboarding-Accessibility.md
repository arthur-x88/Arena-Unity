# Modes, Onboarding & Accessibility

Modes (0.1 and beyond)
- Casual 2v2/3v3: no visible MMR; fast queues; relaxed rules
- Vs AI (Bots): practice, challenges, friendly community anchor
- Custom Lobbies: private matches, spectators (post‑0.1)
- Rated Ladder: post‑0.1; visible rank; seasonal rewards

Onboarding (first 5 minutes)
- 60‑second tutorial: WASD, dash, target swap, cast, cancel, lineup a simple combo
- “Try” mode: spawn a dummy; cycle classes quickly with auto-respawn
- Contextual tips: show one tip after death (e.g., “Try LoS vs ranged ult”)

Accessibility
- Readability presets: colorblind safe palettes; stronger outline on units; option to reduce screen shake
- Input leniency: buffered inputs for combo skills; hold‑to‑aim vs instant cast toggles
- Audio: separate sliders for combat, UI, voice; ducking on critical cues
