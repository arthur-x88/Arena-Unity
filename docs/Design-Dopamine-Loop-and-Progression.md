# Dopamine Loop & Progression Design

Loop Overview
Play → Feedback → Reward → Motivation → Queue Again. Keep the loop short (≤ 8–10 minutes) and satisfying even on losses.

Immediate Feedback
- SFX/VFX impact, combat text, short fanfare on kills and round wins
- Mini-highlights after the match: Top Damage, Best Peel, Clutch Save

Rewards (non-P2W)
- Post‑match rewards: cosmetics shards, emotes, banners, ability skins
- Streak bonuses: 2× shards at 3‑win streak (soft cap)
- Daily/weekly missions: “Win 2 games”, “Land 10 CCs”, “Heal 2000 total”

Progression
- Account level: cosmetics unlock milestones
- Class mastery (light): per‑class medal track (Bronze→Silver→Gold) via use, with no power spikes—pure cosmetics and titles
- Season track (Battle Pass style, optional): strictly visuals; free path fully viable

Loss Cushioning
- Consolation shards on loss; highlight a personal best (“Highest Damage so far!”) to maintain motivation

Anti‑tilt & Session Health
- Short queue + quick rematch option; no harsh penalties for leaving after match
- Hide MMR for casual queue; show visible rank only in rated mode (post‑0.1)
